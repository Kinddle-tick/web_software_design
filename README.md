# web_software_design
one server with multiple client web design with qt(c++) GUI

若仅仅是运行该程序 确保安装好Qt组件后进行编译 可以获得Client和Server两个可执行程序
其中Server开启一个就足够了 但Client需要开启两个以上来保证效果
其他的功能只需要根据GUI的文字提示就可以完成

If you just run the program, make sure that the Qt component is installed and compile it to get both Client and Server executables.
One Server is sufficient, but two or more Clients are required to ensure that they work.
The rest of the functionality can be done by following the textual prompts in the GUI
( But sorry for the lack of language conversion, only Chinese is available at the moment... )
